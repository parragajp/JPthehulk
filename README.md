# JPthehulk Repo

Hi everyone! Here's an open source repository of open files and some projects I have done.

The repo may include:

 - Github Gists
 - CSV Files
 - Machine Learning Projects
 - .ipynb/.py files
 - R files
 
 I love Data Science! Working in Rstudio and Jupyter Notebook is super fun.
